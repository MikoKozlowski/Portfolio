**Hi there!**  
I'm Miko, a data researcher with a strong foundation in cell biology and genomics. This repository showcases my Python scripts, demonstrating my ability to:
1) Manipulate data from various sources (e.g., genomic databases, sequencing experiments)
2) Perform data analysis using libraries like pandas, numpy
3) Visualize data using matplotlib and seaborn
4) Apply AI models to resolve health problems

**Goal**  
Highly skilled Data Researcher specializing in Python and R. Experienced in transforming raw data into meaningful insights through data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. Eager to apply my technical expertise to solve complex problems and contribute to cutting-edge projects.

**Projects**
1) Developed a machine learning model to classify fetal health state into three categories (normal, suspect, pathological) with 94.6% accuracy. [fetal_health_state.ipynb](https://github.com/MikoKozlowski/Portfolio/blob/main/fetal_health_state.ipynb)
2) Compared the efficiency of multiple machine learning models to predict whether a patient has a 10-year risk of coronary heart disease. Reached ~87% accuracy with the best model. [coronary_heart_disease.ipynb](https://github.com/MikoKozlowski/Portfolio/blob/main/coronary_heart_disease.ipynb)
3) Generated and analyzed ATACseq datasets to find transcription factors that drive the development of the novel Schwann cell subpopulation. [ATACseq_peaks_to_FASTA_one_gene.py](https://github.com/MikoKozlowski/Portfolio/blob/main/ATACseq_peaks_to_FASTA_one_gene.py), [Filter_TFs_based_on_RNA_levels.py](https://github.com/MikoKozlowski/Portfolio/blob/main/Filter_TFs_based_on_RNA_levels.py)
4) Visualized the data and prepared the figures for my scientific publication with matplotlib and seaborn. [Example_of_a_figure_ready_barplot.py](https://github.com/MikoKozlowski/Portfolio/blob/main/Example_of_a_publication_ready_barplot.py), [Example_of_a_publication_ready_barplot.jpg](https://github.com/MikoKozlowski/Portfolio/blob/main/Example_of_a_publication_ready_barplot.jpg)

**Skills**
1) Programming Languages: Python (proficient), R (competent), SQL (competent), bash (competent)
2) Data Science Libraries: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, pytorch, bedtools, samtools, bedops, pingouin, statannotations, Git, RStudio, PyCharm, Jupyter 
3) Neuroscience & Genomics Background: peripheral nervous system, Schwann Cells, ATAC-seq, RNA-seq
