Hi there!  
I'm Miko, a neuroscientist with a strong foundation in cell biology and genomics.  
I'm passionate about leveraging my research background and Python expertise to pursue a career in data science within the industry.

This repository showcases my Python scripts, demonstrating my ability to:
1) Manipulate data from various sources (e.g., genomic databases, sequencing experiments)
2) Perform data analysis using libraries like pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn
3) Visualize data using matplotlib or seaborn

Projects
1) Developed a machine learning model to classify fetal health state into three categories (normal, suspect, pathological) with 94.6% accuracy. 
2) Generated and analyzing ATACseq datasets to find transcription factors responsible for the development of the novel Schwann cell subpopulation. [ATACseq_peaks_to_FASTA_one_gene.py](https://github.com/MikoKozlowski/Portfolio/blob/main/ATACseq_peaks_to_FASTA_one_gene.py), [Filter_TFs_based_on_RNA_levels.py](https://github.com/MikoKozlowski/Portfolio/blob/main/Filter_TFs_based_on_RNA_levels.py)
3) Visualized the data and prepared the figures for my scientific publication with matplotlib and seaborn. [Example_of_a_figure_ready_barplot.py](https://github.com/MikoKozlowski/Portfolio/blob/main/Example_of_a_figure_ready_barplot)

Skills
1) Programming Languages: Python (proficient), R (competent), bash (competent)
2) Data Science Libraries: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib/seaborn, bedtools, samtools, bedops
3) Neuroscience & Genomics Background: Cell biology, genomics, data analysis in neuroscience research

Goals  
I'm actively seeking opportunities to utilize my Python and data science expertise on real-world problems in healthcare and finance.  In the medical field, I'm particularly interested in leveraging data analysis to answer critical questions about human health. This could involve tasks like analyzing clinical trial data or developing predictive models for disease risk assessment using machine learning and artificial intelligence.

The world of financial data science also holds great appeal. Here, the vast amount of data offers a chance to use my analytical skills to drive informed decision-making. This could involve analyzing financial market trends, building risk assessment models for loans or investments, or even developing data-driven algorithmic trading strategies.
