**Hi there!**  
I'm Miko, a neuroscientist with a strong foundation in data science and genomics. This repository showcases my Python scripts, demonstrating my ability to:
1) Manipulate data from various sources (e.g., genomic databases, sequencing experiments)
2) Perform data analysis using libraries like pandas, numpy
3) Visualize data using matplotlib and seaborn
4) Apply AI models to resolve health problems

**Goal**  
Iâ€™m a PhD candidate in Developmental, Regenerative, Stem Cell Biology at Washington University, seeking a challenging position as a Data Researcher. I have strong programming/data wrangling skills utilizing python and R with broad exposure to other data science disciplines including Machine learning and visualization.

**Projects**
1) Developed a machine learning model to classify fetal health state into three categories (normal, suspect, pathological) with 94.6% accuracy. [fetal_health_state.ipynb](https://github.com/MikoKozlowski/Portfolio/blob/main/fetal_health_state.ipynb)
2) Compared the efficiency of multiple machine learning models to predict whether a patient has a 10-year risk of coronary heart disease. Reached ~87% accuracy with the best model. [coronary_heart_disease.ipynb](https://github.com/MikoKozlowski/Portfolio/blob/main/coronary_heart_disease.ipynb)
3) Generated and analyzing ATACseq datasets to find transcription factors responsible for the development of the novel Schwann cell subpopulation. [ATACseq_peaks_to_FASTA_one_gene.py](https://github.com/MikoKozlowski/Portfolio/blob/main/ATACseq_peaks_to_FASTA_one_gene.py), [Filter_TFs_based_on_RNA_levels.py](https://github.com/MikoKozlowski/Portfolio/blob/main/Filter_TFs_based_on_RNA_levels.py)
4) Visualized the data and prepared the figures for my scientific publication with matplotlib and seaborn. [Example_of_a_figure_ready_barplot.py](https://github.com/MikoKozlowski/Portfolio/blob/main/Example_of_a_publication_ready_barplot.py), [Example_of_a_publication_ready_barplot.jpg](https://github.com/MikoKozlowski/Portfolio/blob/main/Example_of_a_publication_ready_barplot.jpg)

**Skills**
1) Programming Languages: Python (proficient), R (competent), SQL (competent), bash (competent)
2) Data Science Libraries: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib/seaborn, pytorch, bedtools, samtools, bedops, pingouin, statannotations, Git, RStudio, PyCharm, Jupyter 
3) Neuroscience & Genomics Background: peripheral nervous system, Schwann Cells, ATAC-seq, RNA-seq
