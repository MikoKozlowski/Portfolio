Hi there!  
I'm Miko, a neuroscientist with a strong foundation in cell biology and genomics.  
I'm passionate about leveraging my research background and Python expertise to pursue a career in data science within the industry.

This repository showcases my Python scripts, demonstrating my ability to:
1) Clean and manipulate data from various sources (e.g., genomic databases, sequencing experiments)
2) Perform data analysis using libraries like pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn
3) Visualize data using matplotlib or seaborn

Projects
1) Generating and analyzing ATACseq datasets to find transcription factors responsible for the development of the novel Schwann cell subpopulation. [ATACseq_peaks_to_FASTA_one_gene.py](https://github.com/MikoKozlowski/Portfolio/blob/main/ATACseq_peaks_to_FASTA_one_gene.py), [Filter_TFs_based_on_RNA_levels.py](https://github.com/MikoKozlowski/Portfolio/blob/main/Filter_TFs_based_on_RNA_levels.py)
2) Visualization of the data and preparation of the figures for my paper with matplotlib and seaborn. [Example_of_a_figure_ready_barplot.py](https://github.com/MikoKozlowski/Portfolio/blob/main/Example_of_a_figure_ready_barplot)

Skills
1) Programming Languages: Python (proficient), R (competent), bash (competent)
2) Data Science Libraries: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib/seaborn, bedtools, samtools, bedops
3) Neuroscience & Genomics Background: Cell biology, genomics, data analysis in neuroscience research

Goals  
I'm actively seeking opportunities to apply my skills in Python and data analysis to real-world problems. I'm particularly interested in the medical field, where I could address questions relevant to people's health. This could involve tasks like analyzing clinical trial data or developing predictive models for disease risk assessment using machine learning or artificial intelligence. I'm also drawn to the world of Business Intelligence (BI) and the power of data to drive informed decision-making across various industries.
