Hi there!  
I'm Miko, a neuroscientist with a strong foundation in cell biology and genomics. This repository showcases my Python scripts, demonstrating my ability to:
1) Manipulate data from various sources (e.g., genomic databases, sequencing experiments)
2) Perform data analysis using libraries like pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn
3) Visualize data using matplotlib or seaborn

Goal  
I seek opportunities to leverage my Python and data science expertise on real-world problems. I'm passionate about delving into complex datasets through meticulous data analysis. This allows me to uncover hidden patterns and extract valuable insights, unveiling the mysteries within data. I'm particularly interested in applying AI and machine learning techniques to further enhance this process.

Projects
1) Developed a machine learning model to classify fetal health state into three categories (normal, suspect, pathological) with 94.6% accuracy. [fetal_health_state.ipynb](https://github.com/MikoKozlowski/Portfolio/blob/main/fetal_health_state.ipynb)
2) Compared the efficiency of multiple machine learning models to predict whether a patient has a 10-year risk of coronary heart disease. Reached ~87% accuracy with the best model. [coronary_heart_disease.ipynb](https://github.com/MikoKozlowski/Portfolio/blob/main/coronary_heart_disease.ipynb)
3) Generated and analyzing ATACseq datasets to find transcription factors responsible for the development of the novel Schwann cell subpopulation. [ATACseq_peaks_to_FASTA_one_gene.py](https://github.com/MikoKozlowski/Portfolio/blob/main/ATACseq_peaks_to_FASTA_one_gene.py), [Filter_TFs_based_on_RNA_levels.py](https://github.com/MikoKozlowski/Portfolio/blob/main/Filter_TFs_based_on_RNA_levels.py)
4) Visualized the data and prepared the figures for my scientific publication with matplotlib and seaborn. [Example_of_a_figure_ready_barplot.py](https://github.com/MikoKozlowski/Portfolio/blob/main/Example_of_a_publication_ready_barplot.py)

Skills
1) Programming Languages: Python (proficient), R (competent), bash (competent)
2) Data Science Libraries: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib/seaborn, bedtools, samtools, bedops
3) Neuroscience & Genomics Background: Cell biology, genomics, data analysis in neuroscience research
