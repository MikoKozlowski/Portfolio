Hi! I'm Miko, a neuroscientist with a strong foundation in cell biology and genomics. I'm passionate about leveraging my research background and Python expertise to pursue a career in data science within the industry.

This repository showcases my Python scripts, demonstrating my ability to:
1) Clean and manipulate data from various sources (e.g., genomic databases, sequencing experiments)
2) Perform data analysis using libraries like pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn
3) Visualize data using matplotlib or seaborn

Projects:
1) Generating and analyzing ATACseq datasets to find transcription factors responsible for the development of the novel Schwann cell subpopulation. [ATACseq_peaks_to_FASTA_one_gene.py](https://github.com/MikoKozlowski/Portfolio/blob/main/ATACseq_peaks_to_FASTA_one_gene.py), [Filter_TFs_based_on_RNA_levels.py](https://github.com/MikoKozlowski/Portfolio/blob/main/Filter_TFs_based_on_RNA_levels.py)
2) Visualization of the data and preparation of the figures for my paper with matplotlib and seaborn. [Example_of_a_figure_ready_barplot.py](https://github.com/MikoKozlowski/Portfolio/blob/main/Example_of_a_figure_ready_barplot)

Skills:
Programming Languages: Python (proficient)
Data Science Libraries: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib/seaborn (familiar)
Neuroscience & Genomics Background: Cell biology, genomics, data analysis in neuroscience research

Looking for:
I'm actively seeking opportunities to apply my skills in Python and data analysis to the real-world problems. I'm particularly interested in the medical field, where I could address questions relevant to people's health.  I am also drawn to busssiness and or .....
