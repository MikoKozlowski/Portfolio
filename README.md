Hi! I'm Miko, a neuroscientist with a strong foundation in cell biology and genomics. I'm passionate about leveraging my research background and Python expertise to pursue a career in data science within the industry.

This repository showcases my Python scripts, demonstrating my ability to:
1) Clean and manipulate data from various sources (e.g., neuroscience databases, genomics experiments)
2) Perform data analysis using libraries like pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn
3) Visualize data using matplotlib or seaborn

Projects:
1) Generating and analyzing ATACseq datasets to find a transcription factor responsible for the development of the novel Schwann cell subpopulation. 
Project 1: [Brief description of project 1] (Link to script) - This project focused on , utilizing .
Project 2: [Brief description of project 2] (Link to script) - This project explored , employing .

Skills:
Programming Languages: Python (proficient)
Data Science Libraries: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib/seaborn (familiar)
Neuroscience & Genomics Background: Cell biology, genomics, data analysis in neuroscience research

Looking for:
I'm actively seeking opportunities to apply my skills in Python and data analysis to the real-world problems. I'm particularly interested in the medical field, where I could address questions relevant to people's health.  I am also drawn to busssiness and or .....
